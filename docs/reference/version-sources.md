# Version Sources

This page documents, for every supported language, **where json2vars-setter fetches
versions from**, which candidate sources were considered, **why** the chosen source was
picked, and the language-specific characteristics that follow from it.

## How fetching works

Each language has a fetcher under `json2vars_setter/version/fetchers/`. Most fetchers
extend `BaseVersionFetcher`, which reads **Git tags from a GitHub repository** via the
GitHub REST API, filters them to stable releases, and derives:

- **`latest`** — the most recent stable release
- **`stable`** — a "known-good" release (usually the previous minor/major line)
- **`recent_releases`** — the most recent stable releases (used by the cache feature)

A language whose versions are not cleanly expressed as a single repo's tags (currently
**Java**, **Dart**, and **Swift**) overrides `fetch_versions` and queries an official
API instead.

The dynamic-update strategies map onto these fields:

- `stable` → `[stable]`
- `latest` → `[latest]`
- `both` → `[stable, latest]`

> The **example matrices** under `examples/<lang>/` are hand-curated to the version
> format the language's `setup-*` action expects, which may differ from the raw
> fetcher output (e.g. major-only vs full `X.Y.Z`).

## What the example projects are for

Each `examples/<lang>/` project is a small, self-contained example that the matching
`<lang>_test.yml` workflow runs across the matrix — demonstrating json2vars-setter
driving the language's `setup-*` action end to end.

They are examples only: their exact contents are illustrative and may change. In
particular they are **not** a check that a specific version is installable — that is the
`setup-*` action's responsibility, and its supported-version list can lag the upstream
source the fetcher reads (see the Swift caveat below).

## Per-language details

### Python — `python/cpython`

- **Source:** tags of the official CPython repository (`vX.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** CPython is the reference implementation; its tags are the canonical version
  list. Direct fit for the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** pre-releases (`a`/`b`/`rc`) are excluded; `stable` is the previous
  minor line of `latest`.
- **Pre-release versions (e.g. 3.15):** the fetcher only returns *stable* releases, so a
  beta like `3.15` will not appear in `latest`/`stable` until it ships. You can still test
  against it by listing it in the matrix JSON by hand and setting `allow-prereleases: true`
  on `actions/setup-python` (see the tip in [Getting Started](../getting-started.md)).

### Node.js — `nodejs/node`

- **Source:** tags of the official Node.js repository, **plus LTS metadata** to identify
  Long-Term-Support lines.
- **Candidates:** plain tags only (rejected — Node's notion of "stable" is the current
  **LTS**, which tags alone don't convey).
- **Why:** Node users target LTS releases, so `stable` is resolved to the most recent LTS
  rather than simply the previous minor.

### Ruby — `ruby/ruby`

- **Source:** tags of the official Ruby repository (underscore form, e.g. `v3_4_2`).
- **Why:** canonical source; clean fit for the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** pre-release suffixes are excluded; `stable` is the previous minor.

### Go — `golang/go`

- **Source:** tags of the official Go repository (`goX.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** canonical source; clean fit.
- **Characteristics:** the `go` prefix is stripped; `rc`/`beta` builds are excluded;
  `stable` is the previous minor.

### Rust — `rust-lang/rust`

- **Source:** tags of the official Rust repository (`1.XX.Y`), **plus channel info** from
  `static.rust-lang.org`.
- **Why:** canonical source; channel info documents the `stable`/`beta`/`nightly`
  availability alongside the concrete version.

### PHP — `php/php-src`

- **Source:** tags of the official PHP source repository (`php-X.Y.Z`).
- **Candidates:** none better — there is no official "setup-php" from GitHub, but the
  source repo's tags are authoritative for versions.
- **Why:** clean fit for the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** only tags matching `php-X.Y.Z` exactly are kept (`...RC1`,
  `...beta1`, `...alpha1`, and unrelated tags like `yaf-*` are excluded); `stable` is the
  previous minor. The consumer side uses `shivammathur/setup-php` (the de-facto standard,
  since no official action exists).

### .NET (C#) — `dotnet/sdk`

- **Source:** tags of the official .NET SDK repository (`vX.Y.Z`, e.g. `v8.0.100`).
- **Candidates considered:**
  - **`dotnet/sdk` tags** (chosen) — consistent with the other languages' GitHub-tags
    approach.
  - **`releases-index.json`** release metadata (not chosen) — richer (LTS/STS, support
    phase, per-channel latest), but diverges from the common fetcher pattern.
- **Why:** keeps .NET on the same simple, consistent GitHub-tags mechanism as the other
  languages.
- **Characteristics:** the SDK **minor is always `0`**, so the meaningful release line is
  the **major** (8.0, 9.0, 10.0). `latest` is the newest SDK; `stable` is the newest SDK
  of the **previous major**. `preview`/`rc` tags are excluded. Example matrices use the
  channel form (`"8.0"`, `"9.0"`) that `actions/setup-dotnet` accepts.

### Java — Adoptium API

- **Source:** the **Adoptium API** `GET /v3/info/available_releases`.
- **Candidates considered:**
  - **`openjdk/jdk` tags** (rejected) — that repository carries only **early-access
    builds of the in-development release** (e.g. `jdk-28+0`); GA and LTS lines live in
    separate update repositories, so a single repo's tags cannot represent stable Java
    versions.
  - **`openjdk/jdkXXu` update repos** (rejected) — would require juggling many
    repositories and still mixes build metadata.
  - **Adoptium API** (chosen) — a single authoritative endpoint that reports
    `available_releases`, `available_lts_releases`, `most_recent_feature_release`, and
    `most_recent_lts`.
- **Why:** it is the only clean, single-source way to enumerate real, installable Java
  versions and to distinguish LTS from feature releases.
- **Characteristics:** this is the **only fetcher that does not use GitHub tags** — it
  overrides `fetch_versions`. `latest` = most recent **feature** release (e.g. `26`);
  `stable` = most recent **LTS** (e.g. `25`); `recent_releases` = the available **LTS**
  releases, newest first. The consumer side uses the official `actions/setup-java` with
  the `temurin` distribution; example matrices use major versions (`"11"`, `"17"`,
  `"21"`).

### Deno — `denoland/deno`

- **Source:** tags of the official Deno repository (`vX.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** Deno publishes clean, stable-only release tags (no pre-release noise), so it is
  a direct fit for the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** the `v` prefix is stripped; `stable` is the previous minor of
  `latest`. Example matrices use the channel form (`"v1.x"`, `"v2.x"`) that
  `denoland/setup-deno` accepts.

### Bun — `oven-sh/bun`

- **Source:** tags of the official Bun repository (`bun-vX.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** Bun's release tags are a clean, direct fit for the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** only tags matching `bun-vX.Y.Z` are kept (`canary` and the legacy
  `v0.x` tags are excluded); the `bun-v` prefix is stripped; `stable` is the previous
  minor of `latest`. Example matrices use the form (`"1.2.x"`, `"1.3.x"`) that
  `oven-sh/setup-bun` accepts.

### Zig — `ziglang/zig`

- **Source:** tags of the official Zig repository (plain `X.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** Zig's stable release tags are bare semantic versions — a clean, direct
  fit for the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** only tags matching `X.Y.Z` are kept (`master` and
  `X.Y.Z-dev.*` nightly builds are excluded); Zig is still pre-1.0, so `stable` is
  the previous **minor** (second component) of `latest`. Example matrices use the
  exact form (`"0.14.1"`, `"0.15.2"`) that `mlugg/setup-zig` accepts.
- **Setup action note:** `mlugg/setup-zig` has moved its main repository to
  [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/mlugg/setup-zig). The version fetcher is
  **unaffected** — it reads the `ziglang/zig` *compiler* repo (still on GitHub),
  which is a different project from the *setup action*. The `mlugg/setup-zig`
  GitHub repo used by `zig_test.yml` is now an auto-synced mirror; the maintainer
  commits to keep supporting GitHub Actions, so the pinned `uses:` reference and
  Dependabot tracking continue to work.

### Elixir — `elixir-lang/elixir`

- **Source:** tags of the official Elixir repository (`vX.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** Elixir's release tags are a clean, direct fit for the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** only tags matching `vX.Y.Z` are kept (release candidates
  `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` and the moving `vX.Y-latest` tags are excluded); the `v` prefix is
  stripped; `stable` is the previous minor of `latest`. Example matrices use the form
  (`"1.18"`, `"1.19"`) that `erlef/setup-beam` accepts. `setup-beam` also requires an
  Erlang/OTP version, which the example workflow pins separately.

### Dart — Dart release archive

- **Source:** the Dart SDK release archive on Google Cloud Storage
  (`channels/stable/release/`), listed via the GCS JSON API.
- **Why:** the `dart-lang/sdk` GitHub tags are dominated by per-package tags
  (`analyzer-*`, `meta-*`) with the plain SDK version tags buried, so — like Java —
  Dart uses a dedicated source rather than the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** release "folders" matching `X.Y.Z` are extracted and sorted
  **numerically** (the listing is lexicographic, so `3.9.x` sorts after `3.12.x`);
  `latest` is the newest version and `stable` is the previous minor. Example matrices
  use the form (`"3.11.6"`, `"3.12.1"`) that `dart-lang/setup-dart` accepts.

### Swift — swift.org install API

- **Source:** the official swift.org install API
  (`https://www.swift.org/api/v1/install/releases.json`).
- **Why:** the `apple/swift` GitHub tags are dominated by `DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT`
  tags and the `swift-X.Y.Z-RELEASE` tags do not appear within the first pages of
  the tags listing, so — like Java and Dart — Swift uses a dedicated source.
- **Characteristics:** release `name`s matching `X.Y[.Z]` are kept and sorted
  **numerically**; `latest` is the newest and `stable` is the previous minor. Example
  matrices use the form (`"6.1.3"`, `"6.2.1"`) that `swift-actions/setup-swift`
  accepts, and target `ubuntu`/`macos` (Swift's first-class CI platforms).
- **Caveat:** `swift-actions/setup-swift` installs from its own bundled list of known
  Swift versions, which can lag behind the newest swift.org release. When using the
  dynamic update, pin to versions the action supports if the very latest is not yet
  available there.

### Julia — `JuliaLang/julia`

- **Source:** `JuliaLang/julia` GitHub tags.
- **Characteristics:** stable tags look like `vX.Y.Z`; pre-releases (`-rc`, `-beta`,
  `-alpha`) are excluded. Unlike most repositories, the JuliaLang/julia tag API is **not
  reliably newest-first**, so `julia.py` overrides `_get_github_tags` to sort the stable
  tags **numerically** by semantic version before selecting; `latest` is the newest and
  `stable` is the newest release from the previous minor line. Example matrices use the
  short form (`"1.10"`, `"1.11"`) that `julia-actions/setup-julia` accepts (it also
  accepts an exact `X.Y.Z` or aliases such as `lts` / `nightly`).

### Crystal — `crystal-lang/crystal`

- **Source:** `crystal-lang/crystal` GitHub tags.
- **Characteristics:** stable tags are plain `X.Y.Z` for recent releases and `vX.Y.Z`
  for older ones (both forms are accepted; the `v` is stripped). The tag API interleaves
  those forms with junk tags (`ruby`, `test-ci-1`) and is not newest-first, so — like
  `julia.py` — `crystal.py` overrides `_get_github_tags` to sort the stable tags
  **numerically** before selecting; `latest` is the newest and `stable` is the newest
  release from the previous minor line. Example matrices use exact versions
  (`"1.19.2"`, `"1.20.2"`) that `crystal-lang/install-crystal` accepts, and target
  `ubuntu`/`macos` (Crystal's first-class CI platforms).

### Haskell — `ghc/ghc`

- **Source:** `ghc/ghc` GitHub tags. Final GHC releases are tagged
  `ghc-X.Y.Z-release`; the version is extracted from that pattern.
- **Characteristics:** the tag list is dominated by pre-release (`-rc`, `-alpha`),
  branch-marker (`-start`) and `wip/*` tags and is not newest-first, so — like
  `julia.py` — `haskell.py` overrides `_get_github_tags` to sort the release tags
  **numerically** before selecting. `latest` is the newest; `stable` is the newest
  release from the previous minor line (GHC ships only even minor lines, so this is
  resolved by version rather than `minor - 1`). Example matrices use exact GHC
  versions (`"9.8.4"`, `"9.10.1"`) that `haskell-actions/setup` accepts, and target
  `ubuntu`/`macos` (Haskell's first-class CI platforms).

### OCaml — `ocaml/ocaml`

- **Source:** `ocaml/ocaml` GitHub tags. Stable releases are plain `X.Y.Z` (e.g.
  `5.4.1`).
- **Characteristics:** pre-releases (`5.5.0-beta1`, `5.5.0-alpha1`) carry a suffix and
  the ancient `csl-*` (Caml Special Light) tags carry a prefix, so neither matches and
  both are excluded. The tag list interleaves those and is not reliably newest-first,
  so — like `julia.py` — `ocaml.py` overrides `_get_github_tags` to sort the stable
  tags **numerically** before selecting; `latest` is the newest and `stable` is the
  newest release from the previous minor line. Example matrices use exact compiler
  versions (`"5.2.1"`, `"5.3.0"`) that `ocaml/setup-ocaml` accepts, and target
  `ubuntu`/`macos` (OCaml's first-class CI platforms).

### Kotlin — `JetBrains/kotlin`

- **Source:** tags of the official Kotlin repository (`vX.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** canonical source; clean fit for the GitHub-tags fetcher.
- **Characteristics:** pre-releases carry a suffix (`-RC`, `-RC2`, `-Beta1`, the older
  `-M1` milestones), which an anchored `^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` pattern rejects; unlike Julia /
  OCaml the tags are already newest-first, so no sort override is needed. `stable` is the
  previous minor line of `latest`. There is no official Kotlin setup action, so the
  example downloads the exact `kotlin-compiler-<version>.zip` straight from the matching
  JetBrains release (verifying its published SHA-256) and puts `kotlinc` on `PATH`,
  rather than depending on the third-party (and self-deprecated) `fwilhe2/setup-kotlin`.
  It targets `ubuntu`/`macos` (the Kotlin CLI is driven from a `bash` step, where the
  Windows `kotlinc.bat` is brittle; the compiled JVM bytecode is platform-independent).

### Clang — `llvm/llvm-project`

- **Source:** tags of the LLVM monorepo (`llvmorg-X.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** canonical source for the Clang/LLVM compiler; the axis real C++ CI matrices
  vary over. (The C++ language *standard* — `-std=c++17/20/23` — is a static list you
  hand-write in your matrix JSON, so it needs no fetcher.)
- **Characteristics:** release candidates carry a `-rcN` suffix and each dev cycle opens
  with a non-release `llvmorg-NN-init` tag, both rejected by the anchored
  `^llvmorg-\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` pattern. The tags are already newest-first, so no sort
  override is needed. LLVM bumps the major roughly yearly while the minor is almost
  always `1` (e.g. `22.1.x` follows `21.1.x`), so `stable` is the newest release on the
  **previous version line** (the previous distinct `major.minor`), not "previous minor".
  There is no official Clang setup action, and the LLVM release assets are named
  inconsistently across versions/platforms, so the example uses
  [`aminya/setup-cpp`](https://github.com/aminya/setup-cpp) (the de-facto cross-platform
  compiler-install action) on `ubuntu`/`macos`.

### GCC — `gcc-mirror/gcc`

- **Source:** tags of the GCC mirror (`releases/gcc-X.Y.Z`).
- **Why:** canonical source for the GCC compiler; the other dynamic C++ axis alongside
  Clang.
- **Characteristics:** the tag list interleaves release tags with `releases/libgcj-*`,
  `releases/libf2c-*`, `vendors/*` and `basepoints/*` tags and is **not** reliably
  newest-first, so the fetcher overrides `_get_github_tags` to filter to
  `releases/gcc-X.Y.Z` and **sort by semantic version** (the Julia / Haskell / OCaml
  pattern) before truncating. GCC's release **series is the major** (15.1.0 / 15.2.0 /
  15.3.0 are all "GCC 15"), so `stable` is the newest release of the **previous major
  series**, not the previous minor. There is no official GCC setup action, so the example
  uses [`aminya/setup-cpp`](https://github.com/aminya/setup-cpp); GCC's apt/Homebrew
  packaging is by major, so the example matrix pins majors (`14`, `13`).

### Flutter — official release manifest

- **Source:** the official Flutter release manifest JSON
  (`storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/releases_linux.json`).
- **Why:** the `flutter/flutter` GitHub tags are useless here (they return stale `1.x`
  tags and are not newest-first). The manifest is the authoritative list of released
  Flutter SDKs; the version numbers are platform-independent, so the Linux manifest is
  sufficient (the fetcher overrides `fetch_versions` rather than reading GitHub tags,
  like `dart.py` / `swift.py`).
- **Characteristics:** the fetcher keeps the `stable`-channel entries with a clean
  `X.Y.Z` version (older `1.x.y+hotfix.z` forms are excluded), de-duplicates and
  semver-sorts them. Flutter's stable minors are not contiguous (e.g. 3.41 then 3.44),
  so `stable` is the newest release on the **previous distinct `major.minor` line**.
  Flutter bundles its own Dart SDK and is tracked as a separate language from `dart`.
  There is no official Flutter setup action, so the example uses
  [`subosito/flutter-action`](https://github.com/subosito/flutter-action) on
  `ubuntu`/`macos`.

## Adding another language

See the **"Adding a New Language"** checklist in `CLAUDE.md` for the full set of files to
touch (fetcher, registry, action contract, tests, example, workflow, badges, docs). When
choosing a version source, prefer the language's **canonical GitHub repository tags**;
if those don't cleanly express installable releases (as with Java), use the official
project API and override `fetch_versions`.
