## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful to all contributors and users. I aim to foster an inclusive and welcoming community.

## Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/7rikazhexde/json2vars-setter.git
    cd json2vars-setter
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Option 1: Using uv (recommended)

    !!! note "`uv sync` creates the virtual environment (`.venv`) under the project automatically from `uv.lock`, so there is no need to manually create one."

    ```bash
    # Install uv if not already installed (see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
    # macOS/Linux: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    # Windows:     powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

    # Install all dependencies (incl. dev tools) into .venv
    uv sync
    ```

    Option 2: Using pip with requirements files

    ```bash
    # Download requirements-dev.txt from my official Gist
    curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/7rikazhexde/ee63b33bcb6bb21ac872c5ed41dbf4a6/raw/requirements-dev.txt

    # Install development dependencies
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks**:

    ```bash
    uv run pre-commit install
    ```

    !!! tip "Optional: faster local hooks with prek"

        [`prek`](https://github.com/j178/prek) is a Rust reimplementation of
        pre-commit that reads the **same** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and runs the
        hooks faster (parallel execution, quicker hook-environment setup). It is a
        drop-in for **local** use only — CI and the required checks still run
        `pre-commit`, so adopting it is entirely optional and changes no workflow.

        ```bash
        # Install once (a self-contained binary; see prek's README for other methods)
        uv tool install prek

        # Then use it in place of `pre-commit`
        prek install            # instead of: uv run pre-commit install
        prek run --all-files    # instead of: uv run pre-commit run --all-files
        ```

        If a hook ever behaves differently under prek, fall back to
        `uv run pre-commit` — the configuration is identical.

## Development Workflow

### Creating Issues

Before starting any work, please check existing issues or create a new one to discuss the changes you'd like to make.

- For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior
- For features, explain the use case and proposed implementation

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-your-feature-name
    ```

    Branch naming conventions:  
    Branches must follow the format: `<type>-<short-description>`.  
    Use the following prefixes based on the purpose of the branch:

    - `feature-<description>`: For implementing new features (e.g., feature-newlang-support).
    - `bugfix-<description>`: For fixing bugs (e.g., bugfix-fetch-python-version-error).
    - `docs-<description>`: For documentation updates (e.g., docs-update-readme).
    - `refactor-<description>`: For code refactoring without functional changes (e.g., refactor-cleanup-utils).

2. **Make your changes**:

    - Follow my [coding guidelines](#coding-guidelines)
    - Keep changes focused on a single issue/feature

3. **Commit your changes** using [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/):

    ```bash
    git commit -m "✨ Add new feature"
    git commit -m "🐛 Fix bug in function X"
    git commit -m "📝 Update documentation"
    ```

    Recommended gitmoji conventions:

    - ✨ (`:sparkles:`) - New feature
    - 🐛 (`:bug:`) - Bug fix
    - 📝 (`:memo:`) - Documentation updates
    - ♻️ (`:recycle:`) - Code refactoring
    - 🚀 (`:rocket:`) - Performance improvements
    - 🎨 (`:art:`) - Code style/structure improvements
    - 🧪 (`:test_tube:`) - Add or update tests

    Write clear commit messages that explain what changes were made and why.

    !!! note "Gitmoji drives the release version"

        Releases are automated with [semantic-release-gitmoji](https://github.com/momocow/semantic-release-gitmoji), so the gitmoji you choose determines the next version:

        - 💥 (`:boom:`) → **major** (breaking change)
        - ✨ (`:sparkles:`) → **minor** (new feature)
        - 🐛 `:bug:`, 🚑 `:ambulance:`, 🔒 `:lock:`, ⚡ `:zap:`, 🔧 `:wrench:`, ♻️ `:recycle:`, ⬆️ `:arrow_up:`, … → **patch**
        - Other gitmoji (e.g. 📝 `:memo:`, 🎨 `:art:`, 🧪 `:white_check_mark:`) do **not** trigger a release.

        The full mapping lives in `releaseRules` in `.releaserc.cjs`.

### Testing Changes

!!! note "About the Testing Policy"

      - Test code should be created using pytest
      - Coverage must be at least 95% (ideally 100%)

1. **Run unit tests** (required):

    ```bash
    # Run basic tests
    uv run pytest
    ```

    ```bash
    # Run verbose coverage tests and create report
    just test-cov-verbose
    ```

2. **Run linters** (required):

    ```bash
    # Run all pre-commit hooks
    uv run pre-commit run --all-files

    # Run specific linters
    uv run ruff check json2vars_setter
    uv run ruff format json2vars_setter
    uv run mypy json2vars_setter
    ```

3. **Manual testing**:

    Test the action by using it in a test workflow with various configurations.

### Pull Requests

1. **Push your branch**:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2. **Create a pull request**:

    - Go to the GitHub repository
    - Click "Pull requests" > "New pull request"
    - Select your branch
    - Fill in the PR template

3. **Code review**:

    - Respond to feedback and make necessary changes
    - Keep the PR focused on a single issue/feature

## Coding Guidelines

**Python code**:

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use type hints as defined in my mypy configuration
- Document functions and classes with docstrings
      - Keep functions focused on a single responsibility

**Linting and Formatting** (required)

- My project uses pre-commit hooks for consistent code quality
- All code must pass pre-commit checks before submitting PRs
- Configuration is defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and `pyproject.toml`
- Key linting tools:
      - [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting and formatting
      - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for static type checking
      - [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) for Markdown files
      - [actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) for GitHub Actions workflows
      - [shellcheck](https://github.com/shellcheck-py/shellcheck-py) for shell script checking
      - [validate-pyproject](https://github.com/abravalheri/validate-pyproject) for `pyproject.toml` schema validation
      - [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) for source-code spell checking (config in `[tool.typos]`)
- You can run all linters at once using: `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`

### Modern Quality preview (CI, advisory)

- The [`modern-quality.yml`](https://github.com/7rikazhexde/json2vars-setter/blob/main/.github/workflows/modern-quality.yml) workflow runs an extra, **non-blocking** quality/security suite on pull requests and on `main` (every analysis job is `continue-on-error`; findings appear in the run summary). pre-commit and the test workflows remain the required checks.
- Jobs: `validate-pyproject`, `typos`, [`zizmor`](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor) (GitHub Actions security audit), [`ty`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) (Astral fast type checker — mypy stays canonical), [`pip-audit`](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit) (dependency CVE scan), and [`gitleaks`](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) (secret scan; CI-only).
- All `uses:` actions in `.github/workflows/**` and `action.yml` are pinned to commit SHAs (with the version as a trailing comment) for supply-chain hardening. The example `uses: 7rikazhexde/json2vars-setter@vX.Y.Z` references stay as version tags so usage examples track the released version.
- The **third-party / official** action versions shown in the docs and README usage examples (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-python`, …) are kept in step with the real workflows by [`sync_doc_action_refs.py`](https://github.com/7rikazhexde/json2vars-setter/blob/main/.github/scripts/sync_doc_action_refs.py), which treats the SHA-pinned workflows / `action.yml` (the source of truth Dependabot maintains) as canonical and rewrites the version tag of each matching action in the Markdown examples. It runs as a pre-commit hook (`sync-doc-action-refs`) on any commit that touches the docs or the workflows, and supports `--check` for CI verification. Dependabot never edits Markdown and `sync-version-refs.sh` only syncs the `json2vars-setter` self-reference, so this script closes that gap. Actions used only in the docs (e.g. `dorny/paths-filter`) have no source-of-truth version and are left untouched.

**Testing** (required)

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain or improve test coverage

## Documentation

- Update documentation when making changes that affect user-facing functionality
- Follow my existing documentation style
- Include examples for new features
- Update the README.md if necessary

For MkDocs documentation:

1. **Test documentation locally**:

    ```bash
    uv run zensical serve
    ```

2. **Build documentation**:

    ```bash
    uv run zensical build
    ```

## Core Components Development

When working on my core components, consider the following guidelines:

### JSON to GitHub Output Parser (`github_output.py`)

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing JSON structures
- Ensure proper error handling for malformed JSON
- Optimize for performance with large JSON files

### Dynamic Matrix Updater (`matrix_update.py`)

- Keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) when implementing different language fetchers
- Handle API rate limits gracefully
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Version Cache Manager (`version_cache.py`)

- Ensure thread-safety for file operations
- Optimize disk I/O and API calls
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing cache formats

## Release Process

Releases are automated with [semantic-release-gitmoji](https://github.com/momocow/semantic-release-gitmoji) via the `semantic-release.yml` workflow (manually triggered by a repository administrator). The process involves:

1. **Version bumping**

     - The next version is derived automatically from the gitmoji of the commits since the last release (see "Gitmoji drives the release version" above)
     - `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are updated, and every `uses: 7rikazhexde/json2vars-setter@vX.Y.Z` usage example is synced to the new version

2. **Creating a release**

     - `CHANGELOG.md` is updated and the version-bump changes are committed back to `main`
     - A tag (format `vX.Y.Z`, e.g. `v1.3.0`) and a GitHub release are created automatically

3. **Documentation deployment**

     - Occurs automatically when changes are merged/pushed to the main branch
     - Handled by a dedicated deployment workflow
