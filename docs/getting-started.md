# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and use the JSON to Variables Setter action in your GitHub workflow.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository where you want to implement the action
- Basic understanding of GitHub Actions workflows

## Installation

As this is a GitHub Action, there's no installation required. You simply reference the action in your workflow file.

## Try It Locally (No GitHub Needed)

Before wiring the action into a workflow, you can run the **exact same parsing logic** on your own machine and see precisely which outputs it would expose. The package ships a `json2vars` CLI. Inside a workflow the action writes its outputs to the file named by `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`; locally that is simply a file path you choose, so you can open it and read the result.

### Step 1: Create a small matrix file

Save this as `matrix.json`:

```json
{
  "os": ["ubuntu-latest", "macos-latest"],
  "versions": { "python": ["3.12", "3.13"] },
  "ghpages_branch": "gh-pages"
}
```

### Step 2: Run the parser

From a clone of this repository (uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```bash
uv sync
GITHUB_OUTPUT=out.txt uv run json2vars parse matrix.json
```

Or without cloning — `uvx` fetches and runs the CLI straight from GitHub:

```bash
GITHUB_OUTPUT=out.txt uvx --from git+https://github.com/7rikazhexde/json2vars-setter json2vars parse matrix.json
```

### Step 3: Inspect the outputs

```bash
cat out.txt
```

```text
OS=["ubuntu-latest", "macos-latest"]
OS_0=ubuntu-latest
OS_1=macos-latest
VERSIONS_PYTHON=["3.12", "3.13"]
VERSIONS_PYTHON_0=3.12
VERSIONS_PYTHON_1=3.13
GHPAGES_BRANCH=gh-pages
```

Each line is one workflow output: the full JSON list (`VERSIONS_PYTHON`), each indexed element (`VERSIONS_PYTHON_0`, `VERSIONS_PYTHON_1`), and scalars such as `GHPAGES_BRANCH`. This is exactly what `${{ steps.json2vars.outputs.* }}` reads when the action runs in a workflow — so what you see locally is what you get in CI.

!!! tip "Explore the other commands"
    Run `json2vars usage` for a task-oriented guide. Beyond `parse`, the CLI also exposes `update-matrix` (rewrite the matrix file with the latest/stable versions fetched from upstream) and `cache-version` (maintain a version cache) — the same engines behind the action's [dynamic update](features/dynamic-update.md) and [version caching](features/version-caching.md) features. Those two reach out to GitHub APIs, so set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid rate limits.

### Tab completion (bash & PowerShell)

The CLI ships shell completion for the commands (`parse`, `update-matrix`,
`cache-version`, `usage`), **their options, and option values**:

- `json2vars <TAB>` → the subcommands
- `json2vars cache-version <TAB>` → that command's options (`--languages`,
  `--max-age`, …). With the PowerShell block below they appear at the bare command
  position; in bash, type a leading `-` first (`cache-version -<TAB>`), since
  Click only completes option names once the word starts with a dash.
- `json2vars cache-version --languages <TAB>` → the supported languages;
  `json2vars update-matrix --python <TAB>` → `stable/latest/both`

#### bash

Install once with the built-in command (it auto-detects your shell), then restart
the shell:

```bash
json2vars --install-completion
```

Or wire it up by hand:

```bash
json2vars --show-completion >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### PowerShell

Add the block below to your `$PROFILE` (open it with `notepad $PROFILE`), then
restart the shell:

```powershell
$json2varsCompleter = {
    param($wordToComplete, $commandAst, $cursorPosition)
    $base = $commandAst.ToString()
    $seen = @{}
    $results = [System.Collections.Generic.List[System.Management.Automation.CompletionResult]]::new()
    $fetch = {
        param($a, $w)
        $Env:_JSON2VARS_COMPLETE = "complete_powershell"
        $Env:_TYPER_COMPLETE_ARGS = $a
        $Env:_TYPER_COMPLETE_WORD_TO_COMPLETE = $w
        try {
            json2vars | Where-Object { $_ -like '*:::*' } | ForEach-Object {
                $i = $_.IndexOf(':::')
                $v = $_.Substring(0, $i)
                if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($v) -or $seen.ContainsKey($v)) { return }
                $seen[$v] = $true
                $h = $_.Substring($i + 3).Trim()
                if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($h)) { $h = $v }
                $results.Add([System.Management.Automation.CompletionResult]::new(
                        $v, $v, 'ParameterValue', $h))
            }
        }
        finally {
            $Env:_JSON2VARS_COMPLETE = ""
            $Env:_TYPER_COMPLETE_ARGS = ""
            $Env:_TYPER_COMPLETE_WORD_TO_COMPLETE = ""
        }
    }
    & $fetch $base $wordToComplete
    # Nothing matched at an empty word (an option position, no dash typed): offer
    # the command's option names so they are discoverable without a leading '-'.
    if ($results.Count -eq 0 -and [string]::IsNullOrEmpty($wordToComplete)) {
        & $fetch ($base.TrimEnd() + ' -') '-'
    }
    $results
}
Register-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName json2vars -ScriptBlock $json2varsCompleter
```

!!! note "Why not `json2vars --show-completion` on PowerShell?"
    Typer's generated PowerShell completer splits each candidate on `:::` and
    builds a `CompletionResult` whose tooltip must be non-empty. When an option's
    help is long, Typer wraps it across lines; the wrapped fragment has no `:::`,
    so the tooltip is empty and `CompletionResult` **throws** — making a whole
    command (e.g. `cache-version`) return *no* completions, and **leaking the
    completion env vars** (after which a normal `json2vars … --help` prints
    completion noise instead of help). The block above keeps only lines containing
    `:::`, splits on the first one, falls back to the value for an empty tooltip,
    resets the env vars in `finally`, and (only when a bare word matched nothing)
    re-queries to surface the option names — so it stays robust *and* discoverable.

!!! tip "Seeing the candidate menu (PowerShell)"
    PowerShell's default `Tab` inserts the first match and cycles one at a time.
    To pop up a **navigable menu** and pick with the arrow keys, press
    **Ctrl+Space** (PSReadLine's built-in `MenuComplete`) — no keybinding change
    needed, so your existing key setup is left untouched.

!!! note "Multi-value `--languages`"
    Because options are completed one value at a time, pass several languages by
    **repeating the flag** when using the `json2vars` script:
    `json2vars cache-version --languages python --languages nodejs`. (The
    `python -m json2vars_setter.features.version_cache --languages python nodejs`
    form still accepts the space-separated list.)

## Basic Setup

### Step 1: Create a JSON Configuration File

First, create a JSON file to define your matrix testing environment. By default, the action looks for this file at `.github/json2vars-setter/matrix.json`.

Here's a basic example:

```json
{
    "os": [
        "ubuntu-latest",
        "windows-latest",
        "macos-latest"
    ],
    "versions": {
        "python": [
            "3.10",
            "3.11",
            "3.12",
            "3.13",
            "3.14"
        ]
    },
    "ghpages_branch": "gh-pages"
}
```

You only need to include the languages your project uses. For example, if your project only uses Python, you don't need to include other languages like Ruby or Node.js.

!!! tip "Python 3.15 (pre-release)"
    The action just passes version strings through, so you can list any version your
    `setup-*` action accepts — including **Python 3.15**, which is currently a
    pre-release. Because `actions/setup-python` does not resolve a bare `"3.15"` to a
    beta by default, add it to the list **and** set `allow-prereleases: true` on the
    setup step:

    ```yaml
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v7.0.0
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}  # e.g. "3.15"
        allow-prereleases: true
    ```

### Step 2: Configure Your Workflow

Add the JSON to Variables Setter action to your workflow file. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
name: Build and Test

jobs:
  set_variables:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      os: ${{ steps.json2vars.outputs.os }}
      versions_python: ${{ steps.json2vars.outputs.versions_python }}
      ghpages_branch: ${{ steps.json2vars.outputs.ghpages_branch }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v7.0.1

      - name: Set variables from JSON
        id: json2vars
        uses: 7rikazhexde/json2vars-setter@v1.13.0
        with:
          json-file: .github/json2vars-setter/sample/matrix.json
```

!!! important
    Make sure to define the outputs at the job level if you plan to use them in other jobs.

### Step 3: Use the Generated Variables

Now you can use the variables in your workflow. There are several ways to access them:

#### Within the Same Job

```yaml
- name: Access Variables
  run: |
    echo "OS List: ${{ steps.json2vars.outputs.os }}"
    echo "First OS: ${{ fromJson(steps.json2vars.outputs.os)[0] }}"
    echo "Python Versions: ${{ steps.json2vars.outputs.versions_python }}"
```

#### With a Matrix Strategy

```yaml
test_matrix:
  needs: set_variables
  strategy:
    matrix:
      os: ${{ fromJson(needs.set_variables.outputs.os) }}
      python-version: ${{ fromJson(needs.set_variables.outputs.versions_python) }}

  runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

  steps:
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v7.0.0
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```

## Available Outputs

The action provides the following outputs:

| Output             | Description                |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| `os`               | List of operating systems  |
| `versions_python`  | List of Python versions    |
| `versions_ruby`    | List of Ruby versions      |
| `versions_nodejs`  | List of Node.js versions   |
| `versions_go`      | List of Go versions        |
| `versions_rust`    | List of Rust versions      |
| `versions_php`     | List of PHP versions       |
| `versions_dotnet`  | List of .NET (C#) versions |
| `versions_java`    | List of Java versions      |
| `versions_deno`    | List of Deno versions      |
| `versions_bun`     | List of Bun versions       |
| `versions_zig`     | List of Zig versions       |
| `versions_elixir`  | List of Elixir versions    |
| `versions_dart`    | List of Dart versions      |
| `versions_swift`   | List of Swift versions     |
| `versions_julia`   | List of Julia versions     |
| `versions_crystal` | List of Crystal versions   |
| `versions_haskell` | List of Haskell versions   |
| `versions_ocaml`   | List of OCaml versions     |
| `versions_kotlin`  | List of Kotlin versions    |
| `versions_clang`   | List of Clang/LLVM versions |
| `versions_gcc`     | List of GCC versions       |
| `versions_flutter` | List of Flutter versions   |
| `ghpages_branch`   | GitHub Pages branch name   |

!!! tip "How to refer to Output in subsequent steps or jobs"

    - When accessing list variables (like `os` or `versions_python`), always use the `fromJson()` function to parse the JSON string.
    - For shell scripts, use single quotes (`'`) around the JSON string to preserve its structure.
    - If you don't define a language in your JSON file, its corresponding output will be an empty array.
    - You can create language-specific JSON files (e.g., `python_project_matrix.json`) for different projects.
